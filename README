Columbus Scala Enthusiasts
==========================

Group Project
-------------

This is, or will be, or at least _may_ be, the group project for the Columbus Scala Enthusiasts.

Right now, it's little more than a newly-generated play! application ("play new CSE"), useful only 
for setting up a remote development environment around; but eventually we'll decide more about what 
we hope it'll turn out to be.
